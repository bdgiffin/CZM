# CZM - Interactive *C*ohesive *Z*one *M*odeling Library

**CZM** is an interactive **C**ohesive **Z**one **M**odeling engine designed to run in real time, created primarily for educational purposes.

As a demonstration of the project's core capabilities, an interactive earthquake simulator has been developed which incorporates cohesive failure and dynamic behavior excited by an earthquake ground motion taken from the PEER database. You can experiment with the [playable demo here](https://bdgiffin.github.io/CZM/)! The basic controls are explained below:
 - Left Mouse Button: Add material to the selected grid cell.
 - Right Mouse Button: Remove material from the selected grid cell.
 - Mouse Wheel: Switch between material types.
 - `s`: Start (or restart) the dynamic simulation.
 - `r`: Erase the current material layout.
 - `e`: Edit material layout.
